# Project Name: Resolution Center

## Project Description
This project is a web application designed to simulate a real‑world 
customer service Resolution Center. The system allows customers to submit complaints, 
upload supporting files, and track resolution progress. Administrators manage users and 
assign technicians, while technicians handle assigned complaints, add notes, and upload 
diagnostic files.
The project demonstrates practical skills in database design, secure backend development, 
MVC architecture, validation, authentication, file handling, and iterative software development practices.

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Planning and Design**
- Defined project scope, user roles, and core system requirements
- Designed the database schema (tables, relationships, constraints)
- **Task 2: Database Connection and Initial UI**
- Created configuration and database connection files
- Built registration and login pages with form validation
- **Task 3: MVC Architecture and Core Features**
- Implemented CRUD operations for all major entities
- Built model classes and developed controller classes 
- **Task 4: Security, Authentication, Access Control**

- Added role‑based authorization
- **Task 5: File Uploads and Test Functions**
- Integrated image uploads into the complaint submission workflow
- Tested file uploads with valid/invalid inputs
- **Task 6: Finalize and Submit**
- Thoroughly test all system functions and apply any necessary fixes  
- Sumbit project to GitHub
  
## Project Skills Learned
- Secure file upload handling
- Implementing secure login systems and role‑based permissions
- Relational database modeling and schema design
- Utilizing iterative planning strategies throughout development
- Debugging distributed application logic across multiple files
- GitHub repository setup, organization, and ongoing version control management 
  
## Language Used
- PHP: Chosen because it makes building dynamic, server‑side web applications straightforward.
- MySQL: Used because it reliably stores structured data in an organized relational format. 

## Development Process Used
- Agile Methodology: Using weekly sprint cycles, incremental
  development, continuous quality checks, and progressive feature integration.
